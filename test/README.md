    *Runs the build tasks then pushes the `dist/` folder to the remote
    `gh-pages` branch.*

:small_red_triangle:
We're using `dist/test` so we can have both the **Scally Test Suite** and the
**Scally Docs** available at this GitHub Pages URL:
<http://scally.github.io/>. **Scally Docs** sits in the root of the `gh-pages`
branch, the **Scally Test Suite** sits in the `test` sub-folder, available at: <http://scally.github.io/scally/test>.
