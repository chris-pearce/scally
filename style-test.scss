/**
 * Scally, being an OO framework, works in keeping with the open/closed
 * principle. Any custom styles *SHOULD NOT* be added or modified in Scally
 * directly. This also allows the framework to be updated seamlessly.
 *
 * Contents:
 *
 * Your settings.........your project-specific settings.
 * Scally framework......the entire Scally framework including your overrides.
 * Your styles...........all your project-specific styles.
 *
 * N.B. the above order and the order within the Scally framework section must
 * always be followed.

   ========================================================================= */

/**
 * By default everything is imported. But if you want to be selective and you
 * definitely should, so your CSS is as lean as possible, then only import what
 * you want. The Core section is however mandatory.
 *
 * Any settings you find set in Scally that you do not wish to keep, simply
 * redefine above/below the relevant `@import`. This means that if Scally, for
 * example, sets your `$font-size` at `16px` and you wish it to be `14px`,
 * simply redeclare it above the relevant `@import`, like so:
 *
   $font-size: 14;
   @import "bower_components/scally/core/settings/typography";
 *
 * If you want to use a Scally setting to override something then you need to
 * define the override below the `@import`, like so:
 *
   @import "bower_components/scally/core/settings/colours";
   $colour-text-base: $colour-brand;
 *
 * If you try to redeclare above the `@import` your Sass won't compile as you
 * don't have access to the Scally setting at the point of compilation.
 *
 * All non-Core settings need to be overridden above the `@import`, like so:
 *
   $u-arrow-size-base: 14;
   $u-arrow-colour: orange;
   @import "bower_components/scally/utilities/u-arrow";
 *
 * Scally ignores its own settings in favour of using your own, so you can
 * completely modify how Scally works without ever having to alter the
 * framework itself.
 *
 * N.B. the order specified below must always be followed or Scally will
 * break and if you're not using Bower or you customise where Bower installs
 * then you'll need to update the `@import` paths accordingly.
 *
 * Contents:
 *
 * CORE
 * LAYOUT
 * COMPONENTS
 * UTILITIES
