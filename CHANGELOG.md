## 3.0.0 (?)

- **Non-backwards compatible**<br>
  Revamped all of Scally settings, e.g.:
    - Introduced namespacing.
    - Reduced the colour settings.
    - **Typography** settings:
        - Introduced a new `$scally-g-max-line-length` setting.
        - Introduced a new set of `font-weight` settings.
        - Removed the following settings:
            - `$font-family-icons`.
            - `$font-family-serif`.
- **Non-backwards compatible**<br>
  Combined all of the Scally settings into the one partial: `_settings.scss`.
  Prior to `v3.0.0` **Local** settings existed in there relevant partial, e.g.
  `_forms.scss`, `_o-list.scss`, etc. Overriding any **Local** settings prior
  to `v3.0.0` had to be done in your master stylesheet above the relevant
  Scally partial, e.g.:

    ```scss
    $html-element-background-color: $color-black;
    $apply-osx-font-smoothing: true;
    @import "[path/to/the/scally/library]/core/base/root";
    ```
  We came to dislike this approach as it wasn't easy to maintain for the
  following reasons:
    - **Local** settings being dispersed throughout the master stylesheet made
      it hard to keep track of everything and created a disconnect between the
      **Global** and **Local** settings.
    - We feel your master stylesheet should only contain Sass partial imports.
- **Non-backwards compatible**<br>
  **Components** removed as they didn't fit the model of an un-opinionated
  foundational CSS library.
- **Non-backwards compatible**<br>
  **Objects** removed as they seemed to cause to much confusion as to exactly
  what they were. Some **Objects** still exist, whether only partially or in
  full, they're just not regarded as **Objects** any more.
- **Non-backwards compatible**<br>
  Completely redone the folder/file structure. Everything now lives in a
  `src` folder without any sub folders. Only Sass partials and a main index
  file for the CSS library live in `src`.
- Created a `scally.scss` file which is the main index file for the CSS
  library.
- Added an `index.js` file for Scally's NPM module.

  [stylelint](http://stylelint.io/).
