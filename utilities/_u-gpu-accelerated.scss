/**
 * This utility will trigger browsers into enabling GPU rendering for better
 * rendering performance, but it's not wise to use on everything just for the
 * sake of hardware acceleration. So make sure to understand when and when
 * not to use this.
 *
 * N.B. the new `will-change` property will eventually make this hack
 * redundant, see:
 * http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-css-will-change-property/.
