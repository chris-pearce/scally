/**
 * Here we set breakpoints. Not every media query will be able to use one of
 * these breakpoints and that's fine as they're no magic numbers with
 * breakpoints i.e. if the UI needs to change then it needs to change. But
 * most of the time we can use them.
 *
 * The breakdown of the breakpoints is based off this chart:
 * http://static.lukew.com/unified_device_design.png
 *
 * Here's the thinking:
 *
 * - Palm: smartphones and featurephones i.e. anything that can fit into the
 *   palm of a hand.
 * - Lap: typically tablets, notebooks and laptops i.e. anything that is
 *   portable that doesn't include phones.
 * - Lap small: smaller tablets/notebooks and e-readers e.g. Kindle.
 * - Lap large: larger tablets and laptops.
 * - Desk: desktop computers, TV's, etc. i.e. anything that is not portable.
 * - Desk small: smaller desktop computer monitors.
 * - Desk large: larger desktop computer monitors, TV's, and who knows what
 *   else?
 *
 * The breakpoints:
 *
 * - Palm:         0 - 640px
 *
 * - Lap:          641px +
 * - Lap large:    901px +
 *
 * - Desk:         1200px +
 * - Desk large:   1366px +
